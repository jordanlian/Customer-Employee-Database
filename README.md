# Customer-Employee-Database-GUI
### Final Project for Engineering Database Systems
I created a database using database design concepts including referential and entity integrity. 
I used SQL scripts to create the tables and Python to import the data from txt files. 
I used HTML to create the GUI front-end, and I used Python to generate reports using SQL embedded scripts in the files.
